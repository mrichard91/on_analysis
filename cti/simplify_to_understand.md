# The power of reductionism in understanding malware
I'm fond of saying "there is no such thing as malware, only software that abets humans with malicious intent". Of course, this is a highly reductionist point of view; it simplifies a word like malware to its literal meaning of "malicious software" and then asks what it means for software to be malicious. The answer to this question would appear to be simple, that the software must codify an act of malice. This then begs the question of what is an act of malice; is it the downloading and executing of new code? is it allowing a new user to access the computer using a custom tool? is wiping all data from a system or encrypting its contents an act of malice?
